# Humanitarian Aid Warehouse Optimization

This repository contains an optimization model and documentation for strategic placement of humanitarian aid warehouses to improve disaster response in Turkey's Aegean and Marmara regions.

## Project Overview
The project aims to optimize the location, size, and number of warehouses to minimize costs while ensuring timely delivery of aid supplies to high-risk and affected areas. The model incorporates population data, risk levels, transportation distances, and warehouse capacity constraints using integer programming.

## Contents
- `WAREHOUSE_OPTIMIZATION.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing the optimization model with Pyomo.
- `Humanitarian Aid Warehouse Modeling Documentation.pdf`: Detailed project documentation including problem formulation, assumptions, results, and scenario analyses.

## Key Features
- Multi-region warehouse placement considering geographic and risk factors.
- Balances fixed infrastructure and transportation costs.
- Supports scenario analysis for demand surges, economic efficiency, and rapid response.
- Produces detailed warehouse location, sizing, and utilization outputs.

## How to Run
- Requires Python with Pyomo and a solver like GLPK installed.
- Run `WAREHOUSE_OPTIMIZATION.ipynb` in Jupyter to reproduce results or explore scenarios.
